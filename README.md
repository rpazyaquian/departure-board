# Departure Board

A basic implementation of a real-time(-ish) MBTA departures board, leveraging both React and Phoenix channels.

**This project is not designed to run in production. It is only a toy app.**

# Usage

To start the Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `cd assets && npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Then visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
